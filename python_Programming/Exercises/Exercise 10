What happens when you enter the following in the Python shell?
a. 123.456.789
b. 123_456_789
c. hello
d. "hello'
e. "Hello" "World!" (this one may surprise you!)
f. 1,000 (this one, too, may surprise you!)
g. 1,000.234
h. 1,000,000,000
i. '1,000,000,000'


------

a. 123.456.789
This will raise a SyntaxError because the period . is not allowed in the middle of a number literal.

b. 123_456_789
This is a valid integer literal using underscores for readability. It represents the number 123456789.

c. hello
If hello is not defined as a variable or function, Python will raise a NameError as it doesn't recognize it.

d. "hello'
This will raise a SyntaxError because the string literal is not properly terminated with a closing quotation mark '.

e. "Hello" "World!"
This will concatenate the two string literals "Hello" and "World!" into a single string "HelloWorld!".

f. 1,000
This will not raise an error, but it's interpreted as a tuple with two elements: (1, 000) due to the comma ,.

g. 1,000.234
Similar to 1,000, this will be interpreted as a tuple (1, 000.234).

h. 1,000,000,000
Similar to 1,000, this will also be interpreted as a tuple (1, 000, 000, 000).

i. '1,000,000,000'
This is a valid string literal containing the characters '1,000,000,000'.
