a. Now that weâ€™ve learned a little about modular arithmetic, reconsider the numerals we use in our decimal (base 10) system. In that
system, why do we have only the numerals 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,
and 9?
b. What numerals would we need in a base 7 system? How about base
5?

-------

a. In the decimal system (base 10), we have 10 numerals (0 through 9) because each digit's value represents a power of 10 based on its position within the number.

b. In a base 7 system, we need numerals representing values 0 through 6. In a base 5 system, we need numerals representing values 0 through 4.
